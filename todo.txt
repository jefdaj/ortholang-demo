parse errors not showing up on site; it just silently fails
expand/fix repl sizing on different screens
fix shortcut terminal width to match?
simplify ggplot plots to look figure like
rename Collaborate page to "My Scripts" (or username would be better) and make it a collection of that user's scripts (incl guest)!
  can still write in the comments, and people won't think it's creepy the same way :D
  then all you really need is a log in/out button above the user scripts page to make it nice
    will need to figure out how to do the proper http logout hack
    and try highlighting the user tab a different color?
    wait no, move it to the far right so it's spacially separated and the logout button goes in the standard spot
  add a quick explanation + filter box like the other pages
    move user account info from site -> the guest user page
