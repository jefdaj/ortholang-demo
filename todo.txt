fix the "new result auto-running" bug
make sure all errors are visible in the web repl
have clients ping the server periodically so their guest repls can be removed on disconnect
allow result to be a list, and allow the list to be untyped
add a thing to the website that zips up an archive of the result list
loading a new script should also kill the currently running one
:help should show a list of possible completions if nothing matches exactly (ie "diamond" -> diamond_*)
should allow multiple results in an untyped list, and you could zip them up as a download!
parse errors not showing up on site; it just silently fails
expand/fix repl sizing on different screens
fix shortcut terminal width to match?
simplify ggplot plots to look figure like
rename Collaborate page to "My Scripts" (or username would be better) and make it a collection of that user's scripts (incl guest)!
try highlighting the user tab a different color?
new user login needs dir created with examples symlink
