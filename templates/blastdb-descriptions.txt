Representative_Genomes| Representative bacterial/archaeal genomes database
cdd_delta             | Conserved Domain Database sequences for use with stand alone deltablast
env_nr                | Protein sequences for metagenomes
env_nt                | Nucleotide sequences for metagenomes
est                   | This file requires est_human, est_mouse, and est_others files to function. It contains the est.nal alias so that searches against est (-db est) will include est_human, est_mouse and est_others. 
est_human             | Human subset of the est database from the estdivision of GenBank, EMBL and DDBJ.
est_mouse             | Mouse subset of the est databasae
est_others            | Non-human and non-mouse subset of the est database
gss                   | Sequences from the GSS division of GenBank, EMBL, and DDBJ
htgs                  | Sequences from the HTG division of GenBank, EMBL,and DDBJ
human_genomic         | Human RefSeq (NC_######) chromosome records with gap adjusted concatenated NT_ contigs
nr                    | Non-redundant protein sequences from GenPept, Swissprot, PIR, PDF, PDB, and NCBI RefSeq
nt                    | Partially non-redundant nucleotide sequences from all traditional divisions of GenBank, EMBL, and DDBJ excluding GSS,STS, PAT, EST, HTG, and WGS.

patnt                 | Patent nucleotide sequences. Both patent databasesare directly from the USPTO, or from the EPO/JPO via EMBL/DDBJ
pdbaa                 | Sequences for the protein structure from the Protein Data Bank
pdbnt                 | Sequences for the nucleotide structure from the Protein Data Bank. They are NOT the protein codingsequences for the corresponding pdbaa entries.
